Routing different subnets
Ref: https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?p=68471#p68471

NOTE: your local LAN uses the extremely common subnet address 192.168.0.x or 192.168.1.x. 
Be aware that this might create routing conflicts if you connect to the VPN server from public 
locations such as internet cafes that use the same subnet.


Never use 192.168.0.0/24 or 192.168.1.0/24 (or other common subnets) for your OpenVPN Server LAN :!:
You are advised to change your server LAN to a more unique RFC1918 compliant subnet.
For example: 192.168.143.0/24
